									<h3>My Role</h3>
									<p>Web designer and developer</p>
									<h3>Technologies</h3>
									<p>Balsamiq, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap</p>
									<h3>The Goal</h3>
									<p>The <span class="brand">wei-tang</span> project is a responsive web portfolio that seeks to illustrate my background and past experiences as a software programmer and photographer. In an era where smart tablets and phones are the prevalent media to web access, the design of a digital portfolio can no longer confine itself to the scope of large computer screens. The goal of this project aims to design a personal digital portfolio that showcases my past projects while keeping in mind the audiences on small screens. As I have very limited front-end development experiences, the challenge is to become familiar with the technologies involved in a short span of time.</p>
									<h3>The Process</h3>
									<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
									<p>The first stage of development involves a careful study of current design trends of digital portfolios. Apropose.com provides a useful tool for collecting interesting designs into a trendset for further analysis. For each portfolio example in my curated trendset, I analyzed and recorded the details of its layout, brand, functionality, and trend elements. At this stage, the technologies for web development, namely HTML/CSS coupled with Bootstrap, are also explored with the help of online tutorials.</p>
									<div class="img-content">
										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/weitang/weitang_analysis.png">
										<p class="text-muted">Part of my trendset analysis on Apropose.</p>
									</div>
									<h4>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
									<p>The second stage of development is a quick, low-fidelity design of the portfolio's general layout and architecture. Balsamiq is a helpful website at providing sketch-up components as well as supporting links on your constructed components. In this way, use cases can be emulated on the design.</p>
									<div class="img-content">
										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/weitang/weitang_lofi.png">
										<p class="text-muted">Low-fidelity prototype built with Balsamiq.</p>
									</div>
									<h4>Implementation</h4>
									<p>Since many existing digital portfolio templates are available on the web, I have decided to begin direct implementation after the low-fidelity prototyping stage. StartBoostrap.com provides a plethora of engaging portfolio templates from which I can learn from. For the purpose of this project, I studied the code of two templates, "Agency" and "Stylish Portfolio," and learned from each the elements I admired.</p>
									<h3>The Design</h3>
									<p>I have chosen a "Long Scroll" layout with the fold "filling a single page" and containing "no chrome elements." These are all popular layout trends of 2015, two of which are described in <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/01/4-essential-layout-trends-for-2015/">this article</a>. The fold and sections below on the long page are all minimalistic with a consistent color scheme that seeks to advertise the brand. I sampled from the color scheme "Bow Tie Swimsuit" on COLOURlovers.com, adjusting the color compositions to arrive at a milder tone to advertise the quality of being "quietly sohpisticated." The portfolio project page is designed as a full-screen modal to minimize distraction imposed by homepage contents. </p>

										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/weitang/weitang_design.png">
										<p class="text-muted">Color palette "Bow Tie Swimsuit."</p>
									</div>
									<h3>The Significance</h3>
									<p>In conclusion, this project has been a fun introduction to web development. I had a chance to explore some of the technologies involved with designing a webpage, such as low-fidelity prototyping tools like Balsamiq and responsive CSS selectors.</p>

							<h2>MO.PM</h2>
							<p class="item-intro text-muted">A music playlist management wireframe for mobile platforms.</p>

							<div class="row">

									<h3>My Role</h3>
									<p>UX designer</p>
									<h3>Collaborators</h3>
									<p>Christine Lao, Justin Wu</p>
									<h3>Technologies</h3>
									<p>Lookback.io, Axure, InVision</p>
									<h3>The Goal</h3>
									<p>MoPM is an information architecture wireframe designed for a mobile music application. It aims to improve the playlist management experience for students, the targeted group of users. Students often have different tastes in music, but they may also have different tastes in music-playing applications on their smart phones. The choice of which music application a student uses is not only affected by the music these apps provide, but also largely influenced by these apps'  ease of use. In this project, my team seeks to design a mobile music application that optimizes a user's experience with music playlists. A high-fidelity wireframe must be produced to support two common user scenarios.</p>
									<h3>The Process</h3>
									<h4>Interview</h4>
									<p>Common operations performed with a playlist include creating playlists, editing playlists, removing playlists, merging playlists, listening to playlists, and more. To accurately capture the common user experience with regard to playlists, our team conducted a series of interviews with students from UCSD who use a number of different applications. A few of the questions asked include</p>
									<ul class="text-muted">
										<li>When did you last use a playlist? What were you doing?</li>
										<li>Tell me the last time you made a playlist. Why did you make it?</li>
										<li>Can you show me on your mobile phone how you created the playlist you mentioned above?</li>
										<li>Can you remember any specific occasions or things you tried to do in your music application that made you frustrated? Describe the experience.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>We hoped to understand the playlists'  intended purposes and the contexts under which they are interacted with. We observed how specific use cases are achieved by each user on his or her respective platform as well as their comments on the interaction process. We also intended to recognize users' interaction with very specific features such as buttons and icons on the screen. Lookback.io provides a very convenient interview tool that allows us to record a user's device screen as he or her walk through a specific use case.</p>
									<div class="img-content">
										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/mopm/mopm_interview.png">
										<p class="text-muted">Screenshot of user interaction recorded with Lookback.io.</p>
									</div>
									<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
									<p>Following the interviews, we conducted a round of competitive analysis on three of the commonly used music applications, which include Spotify, KKBOX, and Apple Music. We emulated five of the most common use cases observed from our interviews, recording the steps each app must go through and the components involved for each function. We extracted the first- and second-level navigational labels from each application, noting similarities and differences.</p>
									<div class="img-content">
										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/mopm/mopm_analysis.png">
										<p class="text-muted">Competitive analysis of music applications.</p>
									</div>
									<h4>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
									<p>At the end of our analysis, we discussed and decided on the first-level navigational labels to include in our design. Then, we proceeded to pick the two user scenarios that our wireframe needs to support, listed all the top-level pages involved, established second- and third-level labels in these pages, and listed all the secondary pages and pop-ups involved. A quick hand-drawn prototype was produced during our discussion.</p>
									<div class="img-content">
										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/mopm/mopm_lofi.jpg">
										<p class="text-muted">Low-fidelity prototype drawn by hand.</p>
									</div>
									<h4>High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
									<p>Referencing our low-fidelity prototype, we divided the required pages and pop-ups among our three team members. Each member worked on his or her pages using Azure, a tool whose online community provides many useful resources: we downloaded and utilized the Android and Google Materials Design component package. We also borrowed graphical components from Spotify and Apple Music by taking screenshots on our mobile devices. The completed pages are uploaded to a project on InVision.com, where we can collectively edit the way they are linked and subsequently perform prototype testing. The interactive InVision project can be tested <a href="https://invis.io/BC6FW3SGS">here</a>.</p>

										<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/mopm/mopm_hifi.png">
										<p class="text-muted">Shared wireframe project on InVision.</p>
									</div>
									<h3>The Design</h3>
									<p>There were many difficult design choices discovered through prototyping and testing that we had to resolve. The complete description of these options, trade-offs, and decisions can be read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7vtHOMLycsPOWstZE45NlBBVHM/view?usp=sharing">here</a> in its entirety.</p>
									<h3>The Significance</h3>
									<p>As a programmer, I have always gone directly to the implementation stage when building mobile applications, which is a process that became encumbered with many re-implementations when components are re-designed. This project has been a most enlightening experience, as it introduced to me to a systematic process of design and many useful tools I may utilize during design.</p>
